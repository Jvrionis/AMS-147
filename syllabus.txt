Purpose of the course: To introduce basic computational methods and 
algorithms for solving mathematical problems that arise in different 
areas of science and engineering. The emphasis will be on the analysis 
and implementation of numerical algorithms using MATLAB or OCTAVE.    

Course content: MATLAB basics, solution to nonlinear algebraic equations,
approximation of functions and data, numerical differentiation and 
integration, solution methods for linear systems, numerical methods 
for ordinary differential equations

Assessment: 50% homework assignments, 25% midterm (in class), 25% final 
(in class). Final grades may be subject to adjustments based on 
non-mandatory research projects, or final scientific colloquium 
with the instructor.

Textbook: 
A. Quarteroni, F. Salieri and P. Gervasio, Scientific Computing 
with MATLAB and Octave.
