# AMS-147 Computational Methods And Applications
To introduce basic computational methods and algorithms for solving 
mathematical problems that arise in different areas of science and engineering. 
The emphasis will be on the analysis and implementation of numerical algorithms 
using MATLAB or OCTAVE. <br />
MATLAB basics, solution to nonlinear algebraic equations, approximation of 
functions and data, numerical differentiation and integration, solution 
methods for linear systems, numerical methods for ordinary differential 
equations. <br />
